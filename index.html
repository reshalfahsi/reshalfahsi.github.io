<p>Greeting, I'm Resha!</p>

<p>I am a research engineer with extensive experience in artificial intelligence and robotics, specializing in computer vision and machine learning. My work includes publishing peer-reviewed research on face recognition, object detection, and biomedical image segmentation, as well as contributing to the development of efficient AI models for both cloud-based systems and edge devices. In addition to my core expertise, I maintain a strong interest in natural language processing and life sciences.</p>

<p>I am open to opportunities in AI research, applied machine learning, and computer vision engineering.</p>

<p>The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and â€¦ attack it from every side.

<blockquote style="color:gray;font-size:16px;">
<p>If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms...

<p> â€” Richard Feynman </p>
