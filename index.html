<p>If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?

                    <li>
                        <p> <b>Summary:</b> ConvInCEDNet, a novel lightweight gastrointestinal polyp segmentation model that can run efficiently on a low-end CPU-only device, particularly the Raspberry Pi 4, was proposed. It combines the strength of convolution and involution in a U-shaped encoder-decoder fashion. It was trained and tested on the CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, Endotect, ETIS-LaribPolypDB, KvasirCapsule-SEG, and Kvasir-SEG datasets. It shows competitive performance compared to previous models. </p>
