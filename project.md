Swallowâ€™s nest is one of the commodities that have various benefits for health. To obtain the nest, one could provide a strategic place for the bird to build its nest. To calculate how many nests could be built, it is necessary to count the swallows that settle in the building. One of the options to count the swallows is through AI technology. Here, we use deep learning in computer vision to accomplish the mission. The deep learning architecture we use is specifically named YOLOv5. First, YOLOv5 will detect the existing swallows in the scene. Then, real-time counting will be carried out.
