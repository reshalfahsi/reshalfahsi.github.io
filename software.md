<div align="center">

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}public/image-captioning.gif" width="400">

</div>

Minimal implementation of image captioning API hosted on [Heroku](https://image-captioning-69420.herokuapp.com/). It receives an image and responds with a caption regarding the image. This project's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/reshalfahsi/image-captioning-api).

</div>

A naive implementation of neural network. The code structure is heavily inspired by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). However, this package is used for educational purposes and is not intended to be adopted in production. This project's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/reshalfahsi/neuralnetwork).

<img src="https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-05-31_at_10.30.20_PM.png" width="400">

</div>

PyTorch (unofficial) implementation of Depthwise Separable Convolution. This type of convolution is introduced by Chollet in [Xception: Deep Learning With Depthwise Separable Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357). This package provides ``SeparableConv1d``, ``SeparableConv2d``, ``SeparableConv3d``, ``LazySeparableConv1d``, ``LazySeparableConv2d``, and ``LazySeparableConv3d``. This package's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/reshalfahsi/separableconv-torch).


### COVID19CT3D

<div align="center">

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}public/thorax.gif" width=300 style="float:right margin-left=10cm">

</div>

This tutorial will teach you how to train a Deep Learning model based on 3D Convolution. This model will classify whether the volumetric medical image from a 3D CT scan of the thorax is infected by COVID-19 or not. The model's output is a single-valued tensor that represents the probability of being infected by COVID-19. This tutorial is based on [A tutorial notebook on 3D image classification](https://github.com/hasibzunair/3D-image-classification-tutorial). This project's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/reshalfahsi/covid19ct3d).


### SotoDemoBot

<div align="center">

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}public/sotodemobot.gif" width="400">

</div>

Simple Object detection Telegram bOt DEMO: predict the objects in the given image. Use ``/predict <URL>`` to predict the objects in the image of given url. This project's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/reshalfahsi/object-detection-bot).


### GGB

<div align="center">
